## The Hoover's Institution's GitHub
Welcome to the Hoover Institution's GitHub profile. The purpose of this repository serves as a collaborative platform for scholars to examine, reproduce, and build upon research code and projects from the Hoover Institution's Fiscal Policy Initiative and State and Local Governance Initiative. By making our work openly available, we aim to promote transparency in policy research and enable other researchers to extend and adapt our analytical methods for their own scholarship.

## About Hoover
With its eminent scholars and world-renowned Library and Archives, the Hoover Institution is a public policy think tank that seeks to improve the human condition by advancing ideas that promote economic opportunity and prosperity, while securing and safeguarding peace for America and all mankind.
## Research
The challenges our country faces require us to be provocative and wide-ranging in our thinking. The Hoover fellowship has a specific focus on the key areas of focus that seek to address the pressing needs faced by policy makers at all levels of government, from state and local leaders to national and international leaders. This repository is dedicated to policy in the spheres of:
- Economics
- Energy & Environment
- Health Care
- State & Local
## Fiscal Policy Initiative
The Fiscal Policy Initiative (FPI) conducts research on the most pressing areas of federal fiscal policy. Drawing on economic scholarship and policy expertise, the Initiative provides credible, actionable analysis to inform lawmakers and the public. Its work covers the following issues:
- Tax Policy: FPI examines how federal tax policy affects labor supply, investment, productivity, and long-term economic growth. Research includes the fiscal and economic effects of potential tax reforms, the structure and impact of international taxation, and potential behavioral responses of workers, businesses, and investors from tax policy changes.
- Entitlement Reform: FPI evaluates the long-term sustainability and economic effects of major federal entitlement programs, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well as low-income support programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Research explores how best to adjust these programs to improve their incentives and long-run fiscal sustainability.
- Budget Process Reform: FPI studies the federal budget process and proposals to enhance transparency and enforce fiscal discipline. Areas of focus include reforms to Congressional budget procedures, improvements to budgetary scoring methodologies, and the design of effective fiscal rules.
- Federal Borrowing and Macroeconomic Risk: FPI analyzes the consequences of rising federal borrowing for interest rates, inflation, and private investment. Research also examines the risks that excessive debt poses to long-term economic growth and stability.
## Mission Statement
Now more than five decades old, Herbert Hoover’s 1959 statement to the Board of Trustees of Stanford University on the purpose and scope of the Hoover Institution continues to guide and define its mission in the twenty-first century.

“This Institution supports the Constitution of the United States, its Bill of Rights and its method of representative government. Both our social and economic systems are based on private enterprise from which springs initiative and ingenuity…. Ours is a system where the Federal Government should undertake no governmental, social or economic action, except where local government, or the people, cannot undertake it for themselves…. The overall mission of this Institution is, from its records, to recall the voice of experience against the making of war, and by the study of these records and their publication, to recall man’s endeavors to make and preserve peace, and to sustain for America the safeguards of the American way of life. This Institution is not, and must not be, a mere library. But with these purposes as its goal, the Institution itself must constantly and dynamically point the road to peace, to personal freedom, and to the safeguards of the American system.” - Herbert Hoover
